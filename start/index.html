      It appears as though one of Ga Tech's favorite professors is nowhere to be found. Rumors started circulating late last night that he's been murdered. Before jumping to conclusion however, we've called on you to help us figured out if he was indeed murdered, how did it happen, where did it take place, and who committed this heinous crime. We're counting on you to venture around this building and see if you find the clues to help us find this case once and for all.
