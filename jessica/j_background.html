      <h3><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-user"></i> Personal Background</h3>
      <p>Jessica is involved with the Student Alumni Association and Women in Cable Telecommunications. Both have mentoring programs that are in her words 'fantastic'. She is a member of the GT Arts Think Tank, and a representative on the IAC Graduate Student Advisory Board. She also holds a GRA with the Digital Media program.

      <h3><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil"></i> Psychological Assesment</h3>  
      <p>When Jessica really wants something, she's willing to make sacrifices.  She may not know what those sacrifices are until push comes to shove, but she will make them. When a goal is just out of reach, it's tempting for her to give up just a bit more than one should. And if that goal stays just out of reach, she may find herself on a slippery moral slope, inching across a line she never thought she'd cross. </p>
    </section>

    <section class="col-sm-6 col-md-6">
      <h3><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-glass"></i> Socialization Assesment </h3>
      <p>Jessica is one lady who was born sparking with both mental and physical energy like shock waves. With her child like heart, she loves fantasy, mind games, a light and fun lifestyle. She possesses only a thimbleful of patience. She is quite sharp in her intellect and uses it to analyze situations and people around her. Adventure, change, being able to go when she wants to go, independence, these are traits she holds on to and not give up all too easily for anyone.</p>
